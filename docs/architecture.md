# Intelligent Todo Application Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Intelligent Todo Application, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
The project includes a significant user interface component (React web app), but this document focuses on the complete system architecture including CLI-first approach, shared business logic, and REST API foundation. The web interface is treated as a secondary companion to the primary CLI interface, both sharing common TypeScript business logic.

### Starter Template or Existing Project

**Starter Template Decision:** **N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a completely greenfield project with no existing Node.js setup, starter templates, or boilerplate code. We'll be creating the entire monorepo structure and tooling configuration from scratch, which aligns perfectly with the BMAD methodology of intelligent simplicity - building exactly what's needed without inherited complexity.

### Change Log
| Date | Version | Description | Author |
|------|---------|-------------|---------|
| 2025-09-24 | v1.0 | Initial backend architecture creation based on PRD | Winston (Architect) |

## High Level Architecture

### Technical Summary

The Intelligent Todo Application employs a **monolithic monorepo architecture** with CLI-first design principles, leveraging TypeScript across all components for type safety and code sharing. The system centers around a shared business logic core that powers both CLI and web interfaces, with SQLite providing simple local data persistence and celebration-focused analytics generation. The architecture prioritizes intelligent simplicity through deliberate constraint, avoiding complexity while delivering meaningful productivity insights through minimal behavioral data capture (task timestamps only).

### High Level Overview

**Architectural Style:** Monolithic Application within Monorepo Structure
- **Primary Pattern:** CLI-first with web companion, sharing common business logic
- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with packages for CLI, web, and shared components
- **Service Architecture:** Single Node.js/Express backend serving REST API, with CLI direct database access
- **Data Flow:** User → CLI/Web → Shared Business Logic → SQLite → Analytics Engine → Celebration Reports

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **CLI Primary, Web Secondary:** CLI provides full functionality with sub-1 second responses; web interface offers visual alternative
2. **Shared Business Logic:** TypeScript modules shared between CLI and web ensure consistent behavior
3. **Local-First Data:** SQLite eliminates server dependencies while supporting future PostgreSQL migration
4. **Celebration Analytics:** Monthly summary generation focuses on achievement over performance tracking
5. **Zero Authentication MVP:** Single-user local storage reduces complexity and security surface

### Architectural and Design Patterns

**Core Patterns Selected:**

- **Repository Pattern:** Abstract data access for SQLite with future PostgreSQL migration support - *Rationale:* Enables testing isolation and database technology flexibility while maintaining simple interface

- **Shared Kernel Pattern:** Common TypeScript business logic shared between CLI and web packages - *Rationale:* Ensures behavioral consistency and reduces duplication while supporting CLI-first development approach

- **Command Pattern:** CLI command structure with consistent parsing and execution flow - *Rationale:* Provides extensible command system and clear separation between interface and business logic

- **Strategy Pattern:** Multiple export formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown) with common interface - *Rationale:* Supports user data ownership requirements while maintaining clean extensible design

- **Observer Pattern:** Analytics engine generates insights from task lifecycle events - *Rationale:* Decouples celebration report generation from core task operations, supporting BMAD simplicity principles

## Infrastructure and Deployment

### Infrastructure as Code
- **Tool:** GitHub Actions workflows (no traditional IaC needed for local-first architecture)
- **Location:** `.github/workflows/`
- **Approach:** Declarative CI/CD pipelines with automated testing, building, and deployment

### Deployment Strategy
- **Strategy:** Dual deployment pattern - CLI via npm registry, Web via Vercel static hosting
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (free for public repositories, excellent Node.js ecosystem)
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `cli-publish.yml`, `web-deploy.yml`

### Environments
- **Development:** Local development with SQLite database, hot reload for web interface
- **Staging:** GitHub PR previews via Vercel, npm beta releases for CLI testing
- **Production:** npm public registry for CLI, Vercel production deployment for web interface

### Environment Promotion Flow
```text
Local Development
    ↓ (git push to feature branch)
GitHub Actions CI
    ↓ (automated tests pass)
PR Preview Deployment
    ↓ (PR merge to main)
Production Deployment
    ├── CLI → npm publish
    └── Web → Vercel production
```

### Rollback Strategy
- **Primary Method:** Git revert + automated redeployment
- **Trigger Conditions:** Failed health checks, user-reported critical issues
- **Recovery Time Objective:** Under 10 minutes for web rollback, under 5 minutes for CLI version revert guidance

## Error Handling Strategy

### General Approach
- **Error Model:** Result-based error handling with typed error objects for predictable error management
- **Exception Hierarchy:** Custom error classes extending base Error with specific error types (ValidationError, DatabaseError, NotFoundError)
- **Error Propagation:** Errors bubble up through service layers with context enrichment, transformed to user-friendly messages at interface boundaries

### Logging Standards
- **Library:** winston 3.11.0 for structured logging with JSON output
- **Format:** Structured JSON with timestamp, level, message, context, and correlation ID
- **Levels:** error, warn, info, debug (production logs info and above)
- **Required Context:**
  - Correlation ID: UUID v4 format for request tracing (`req-${uuid}`)
  - Service Context: Package name, version, component (e.g., "cli/v1.0.0/TaskService")
  - User Context: No PII - only session type (cli/web) and operation type

### Error Handling Patterns

#### Business Logic Errors
- **Custom Exceptions:**
  - `TaskValidationError` - Invalid task data or constraints
  - `TaskNotFoundError` - Task ID not found in database
  - `AnalyticsError` - Issues generating celebration summaries
  - `ExportError` - Data export/import failures
- **User-Facing Errors:** Gentle, solution-oriented messages maintaining positive tone
- **Error Codes:** Alphanumeric codes (TASK001, EXPORT002) for support and debugging

#### Data Consistency
- **Transaction Strategy:** SQLite transactions for multi-step operations (task completion + analytics update)
- **Compensation Logic:** Rollback incomplete operations, maintain audit trail for debugging
- **Idempotency:** Task operations idempotent by design - duplicate completions ignored with friendly message

## Coding Standards

### Core Standards
- **Languages & Runtimes:** TypeScript 5.2.2 with strict mode, Node.js 20.9.0 LTS
- **Style & Linting:** ESLint 8.51.0 with `@typescript-eslint/recommended`, Prettier 3.0.3 for formatting
- **Test Organization:** `__tests__/` directories co-located with source, `.test.ts` suffix for all test files

### Critical Rules
- **No console.log in production code:** Always use the winston logger with appropriate levels - console.log bypasses structured logging and correlation IDs
- **All database operations must use Repository pattern:** Never access SQLite directly from services - maintains abstraction for testing and future migration
- **CLI responses must include celebration elements:** Success messages should use positive language and appropriate emojis to maintain user motivation
- **API responses must use ApiResponse wrapper type:** Ensures consistent error handling and response structure across all endpoints
- **Time calculations must use shared utilities:** dateUtils.ts functions prevent inconsistent duration calculations between CLI and web
- **Task operations must be idempotent:** Completing an already-completed task should return success with friendly message, not error
- **Never expose database errors to users:** Transform technical errors into user-friendly messages that maintain the celebration-focused tone
- **All public functions and interfaces must have JSDoc comments:** Every exported function, class, interface, and type must include comprehensive JSDoc documentation with @param, @returns, @throws, and @example tags where applicable - enables proper IDE intellisense and maintains code clarity for AI agents

## Test Strategy and Standards

### Testing Philosophy
- **Approach:** Test-driven development for business logic, test-after for UI components and CLI commands
- **Coverage Goals:** 90% line coverage for shared package, 80% for CLI/API packages, 70% for web package
- **Test Pyramid:** 60% unit tests, 30% integration tests, 10% end-to-end tests focused on critical user workflows

### Test Types and Organization

#### Unit Tests
- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support via ts-jest
- **File Convention:** `*.test.ts` files in `__tests__/` directories co-located with source code
- **Location:** Each package maintains its own unit test suite in `packages/{package}/__tests__/`
- **Mocking Library:** Jest built-in mocking with manual mocks for external dependencies
- **Coverage Requirement:** 90% line coverage for business logic, 80% for service layers

#### Integration Tests
- **Scope:** Cross-package integration, database operations, CLI workflow testing
- **Location:** `packages/{package}/__tests__/integration/` directories
- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - **Database:** In-memory SQLite for fast test execution, isolated test databases per test suite
  - **CLI Testing:** Spawn actual CLI processes with temporary databases for realistic workflow validation
  - **API Testing:** Supertest with Express app instance, temporary SQLite database per test

#### End-to-End Tests
- **Framework:** Jest with custom CLI testing utilities for command-line workflows
- **Scope:** Complete user journeys covering task creation → completion → monthly summary generation
- **Environment:** Isolated test environment with fresh SQLite database, temporary file system
- **Test Data:** Factory functions generating realistic task data with various estimation patterns

### Test Data Management
- **Strategy:** Factory pattern with realistic data generation matching user behavior patterns
- **Fixtures:** JSON files with sample monthly summaries and task data for consistent testing
- **Factories:** `TaskFactory.ts`, `SummaryFactory.ts` generating data with celebration-appropriate variations
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of temporary databases and files after each test suite

### Continuous Testing
- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions runs full test suite on every PR with parallel execution across packages
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmark tests ensuring CLI responses under 1 second, monthly summary generation under 5 seconds
- **Security Tests:** Input validation testing with malicious payloads, SQL injection prevention validation

## Security

### Input Validation
- **Validation Library:** Joi 17.11.0 for schema validation with TypeScript integration
- **Validation Location:** All input boundaries - CLI argument parsing, API request bodies, database writes
- **Required Rules:**
  - All external inputs MUST be validated before processing
  - Validation at API boundary before reaching business logic
  - Whitelist approach preferred over blacklist for task content and commands

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Auth Method:** No authentication system for MVP (single-user local storage model)
- **Session Management:** Not applicable - local file system access only
- **Required Patterns:**
  - File system permissions protect SQLite database from other users on shared systems
  - Future multi-user design documented but not implemented for MVP simplicity

### Secrets Management
- **Development:** No secrets required for local-first architecture
- **Production:** No server-side secrets - all data local to user's machine
- **Code Requirements:**
  - No hardcoded configuration values that could become secrets in future versions
  - Configuration loaded from environment variables or local config files only
  - No API keys, tokens, or credentials in any codebase

### API Security
- **Rate Limiting:** express-rate-limit middleware - 100 requests per minute per IP for web interface
- **CORS Policy:** Strict CORS configuration allowing only localhost and production domain origins
- **Security Headers:** Helmet.js middleware for security headers (XSS protection, content type sniffing prevention)
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Enforced in production via Vercel configuration, optional in local development

### Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest:** Not required for MVP - SQLite file permissions provide adequate protection for todo data
- **Encryption in Transit:** HTTPS for web interface API calls, not applicable for CLI (local file access)
- **PII Handling:** No PII collected beyond task content - all data stored locally on user's machine
- **Logging Restrictions:** Never log task content, user data, or file paths - log only operation types and error conditions

### Dependency Security
- **Scanning Tool:** npm audit integrated into CI/CD pipeline with automated dependency updates
- **Update Policy:** Security updates applied immediately, feature updates reviewed monthly
- **Approval Process:** New dependencies require architecture review to prevent supply chain risks

### Security Testing
- **SAST Tool:** ESLint security rules via eslint-plugin-security for code pattern analysis
- **DAST Tool:** Not applicable for local-first architecture - no running web services to test
- **Penetration Testing:** Not required for MVP due to local data storage model
