# Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for the Intelligent Todo Application, including backend systems, shared services, and non-UI specific concerns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
The project includes a significant user interface component (React web app), but this document focuses on the complete system architecture including CLI-first approach, shared business logic, and REST API foundation. The web interface is treated as a secondary companion to the primary CLI interface, both sharing common TypeScript business logic.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**Starter Template Decision:** **N/A - Greenfield Project**

This is a completely greenfield project with no existing Node.js setup, starter templates, or boilerplate code. We'll be creating the entire monorepo structure and tooling configuration from scratch, which aligns perfectly with the BMAD methodology of intelligent simplicity - building exactly what's needed without inherited complexity.
