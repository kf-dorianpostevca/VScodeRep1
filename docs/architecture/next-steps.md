# Next Steps

## Frontend Architecture
Since this project includes significant UI components (React web application), a dedicated Frontend Architecture document should be created to detail:
- Specific component design patterns and templates
- Detailed state management implementation using React patterns
- UI component library structure and design system integration
- Advanced PWA implementation details and offline sync strategies

## Developer Handoff
The architecture is comprehensive and ready for development team implementation. Use this document as the definitive technical blueprint, with all patterns, standards, and implementation guidance necessary for consistent AI-driven development across the entire application stack.
