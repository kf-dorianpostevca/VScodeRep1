# Epic 3: Web Interface & Cross-Platform Experience

**Epic Goal:** Create a responsive web application that provides visual users with the same functionality as the CLI while maintaining the intelligent simplicity principle. Ensure consistent user experience across both interfaces through shared business logic and design language that emphasizes celebration-focused productivity insights.

## Story 3.1: REST API Foundation and Shared Business Logic

As a developer,
I want a clean REST API that serves both the CLI and web interface,
so that business logic remains consistent and maintainable across platforms.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Express.js REST API provides endpoints for all task operations (CRUD, analytics)
2. API endpoints match CLI functionality exactly for feature parity
3. Shared TypeScript business logic extracted into common modules
4. API responds in under 1 second for all operations per NFR requirements
5. Proper error handling with consistent HTTP status codes and messages
6. API documentation generated automatically from TypeScript interfaces
7. CORS configuration allows local development and production deployment

## Story 3.2: React Web Interface with Task Management

As a visual-interface user,
I want a clean, responsive web application for managing my tasks,
so that I can use the todo system when CLI access isn't convenient.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. React application provides task creation, editing, completion, and deletion functionality
2. Responsive design works effectively on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
3. Tailwind CSS styling creates clean, minimal aesthetic matching brand guidelines
4. Real-time task list updates without page refreshes
5. Keyboard shortcuts for power users (Ctrl+N for new task, etc.)
6. Loading states and error handling provide smooth user experience
7. Offline functionality for core operations using service workers

## Story 3.3: Web-Based Monthly Summary and Analytics Dashboard

As a user who prefers visual data presentation,
I want web-based monthly summaries with charts and visual insights,
so that I can easily understand my productivity patterns and celebrate progress.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Monthly summary page displays same data as CLI with enhanced visual presentation
2. Interactive charts show completion patterns, time estimation accuracy trends
3. Celebration-focused language and positive visual cues (green checkmarks, progress bars)
4. Historical monthly summaries accessible through navigation interface
5. Summary data loads in under 5 seconds as per NFR requirements
6. Print-friendly formatting for users who want physical copies
7. Share functionality for accountability partners or team leaders

## Story 3.4: Progressive Web App Features and Cross-Platform Consistency

As a user switching between CLI and web interfaces,
I want consistent functionality and data synchronization across platforms,
so that I can use whichever interface suits my current context.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Progressive Web App (PWA) features enable installation and offline usage
2. Web app icon and splash screen match application branding
3. Push notifications optional for task reminders (respecting user preference)
4. Data synchronization ensures CLI and web changes appear immediately in both interfaces
5. Consistent keyboard shortcuts and command patterns between CLI and web
6. Web interface provides CLI command reference for power users
7. Cross-platform feature parity maintained automatically through shared business logic
