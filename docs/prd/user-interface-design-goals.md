# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, celebration-focused interface that feels like a quiet productivity companion rather than a demanding system. The design emphasizes quick task entry, effortless completion tracking, and delightful monthly progress revelations. Users should feel accomplished and motivated rather than overwhelmed or tracked. The interface celebrates progress through thoughtful micro-interactions and positive language while maintaining professional simplicity.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Single-click task completion** with subtle celebratory feedback (gentle animation, positive messaging)
- **Rapid task entry** through both keyboard shortcuts and simple forms optimized for speed
- **Progressive disclosure** where advanced features (time estimation, historical views) are available but never prominent
- **Celebration-first analytics** presenting insights as achievements rather than performance metrics
- **Contextual time estimation** that learns and suggests without being intrusive

## Core Screens and Views
- **Main Task Dashboard** - Clean list view with quick-add functionality and completion actions
- **Monthly Summary View** - Celebration-focused analytics highlighting progress and improvements
- **Historical Progress View** - Optional deeper dive into past monthly summaries and patterns
- **Task Detail/Edit Modal** - Simple form for editing task details and time estimates
- **Settings/Preferences** - Minimal configuration for personal workflow adaptation

## Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast ratios, and screen reader optimization to ensure professional users with diverse accessibility needs can effectively use the application.

## Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic inspired by productivity-focused design systems like Linear or Notion's simpler elements. Emphasize whitespace, subtle typography hierarchy, and celebration-positive color choices (soft greens for completion, warm neutrals for interface). Avoid aggressive gamification colors or anxiety-inducing red indicators.

## Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop/laptop usage for professional workflows, with responsive design ensuring mobile usability for quick task additions. CLI interface serves power users who prefer terminal-based workflows.
