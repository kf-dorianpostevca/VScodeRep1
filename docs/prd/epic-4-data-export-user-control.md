# Epic 4: Data Export & User Control

**Epic Goal:** Provide comprehensive user data ownership and control mechanisms that build trust and confidence in the application. Enable seamless data portability, backup capabilities, and transparent data handling that positions the application as a long-term productivity partner rather than a data lock-in platform.

## Story 4.1: Data Export and Backup Systems

As a user concerned about data ownership,
I want comprehensive export capabilities for all my task data and analytics,
so that I can back up my productivity history and avoid vendor lock-in.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `todo export` generates complete data export in JSON format with all task details
2. `todo export --csv` provides spreadsheet-compatible format for external analysis
3. `todo export --markdown` creates human-readable format for documentation or sharing
4. Export includes all historical data: tasks, completion timestamps, monthly summaries, analytics
5. Automated backup system creates periodic exports to user-specified directory
6. Export validation ensures data integrity and completeness before generation
7. Export operations complete in under 10 seconds regardless of data volume

## Story 4.2: Data Import and Migration Tools

As a user switching to this todo system,
I want to import data from other productivity tools,
so that I can migrate without losing my existing task history and habits.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `todo import --csv <file>` imports tasks from standard CSV format
2. `todo import --json <file>` imports from JSON exports of other todo systems
3. Import validation prevents duplicate tasks and handles format inconsistencies
4. Migration guides provided for popular todo applications (Things, Todoist, etc.)
5. Import process preserves timestamps where available for accurate historical analytics
6. Dry-run option allows users to preview imports before committing
7. Import conflict resolution handles overlapping or duplicate entries gracefully

## Story 4.3: Data Privacy and Transparency Features

As a privacy-conscious user,
I want complete transparency about data collection and control over my information,
so that I can trust the application with my productivity data.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `todo privacy` command displays comprehensive data policy and local storage details
2. Clear documentation of what data is collected (only task content and timestamps)
3. Option to anonymize exported data by removing task content while preserving analytics
4. Data retention controls allow automatic cleanup of old completed tasks
5. No external data transmission without explicit user consent
6. Open source license ensures complete transparency of data handling practices
7. Privacy settings persist across application updates

## Story 4.4: Configuration Management and Personalization

As a user with specific workflow preferences,
I want to customize application behavior and maintain these settings,
so that the tool adapts to my productivity style rather than forcing adaptation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `todo config` provides centralized settings management for both CLI and web interfaces
2. Customizable celebration language and insight frequency preferences
3. Time format preferences (12h/24h), date formats, and timezone settings
4. Default time estimates for quick task creation optimization
5. Color scheme and display preferences for both CLI and web interfaces
6. Settings export/import for easy setup on multiple machines
7. Configuration validation prevents invalid settings that could break functionality
