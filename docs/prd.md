# Intelligent Todo Application Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
• Achieve 1,000 active users within 6 months demonstrating market viability for intelligent simplicity approach
• Maintain 40%+ monthly retention rate proving celebration-focused insights reduce productivity anxiety
• Successfully showcase BMAD methodology through engineered restraint and user-psychology consideration
• Enable 80%+ of users to complete tasks within estimated timeframes after 3 months of usage
• Generate minimum 50 GitHub stars validating technical approach and BMAD demonstration value

### Background Context
The productivity app market suffers from a fundamental paradox where users seek simplicity to reduce cognitive load, yet most successful applications compete through feature proliferation that increases complexity and productivity anxiety. Current solutions force users into either overwhelming feature-rich systems that require more management than actual work completion, or generic simple apps that provide no meaningful differentiation to justify migration costs.

Our Intelligent Todo Application addresses this gap by demonstrating how minimal behavioral analytics (capturing only task creation and completion timestamps) can provide meaningful productivity insights through monthly celebration-focused reports. This approach leverages post-pandemic productivity fatigue and growing appreciation for tools that enhance rather than complicate workflows, targeting Atomic Habits enthusiasts and time-conscious professionals who value data-driven self-improvement without obsessive tracking behaviors.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
A minimalist, celebration-focused interface that feels like a quiet productivity companion rather than a demanding system. The design emphasizes quick task entry, effortless completion tracking, and delightful monthly progress revelations. Users should feel accomplished and motivated rather than overwhelmed or tracked. The interface celebrates progress through thoughtful micro-interactions and positive language while maintaining professional simplicity.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Single-click task completion** with subtle celebratory feedback (gentle animation, positive messaging)
- **Rapid task entry** through both keyboard shortcuts and simple forms optimized for speed
- **Progressive disclosure** where advanced features (time estimation, historical views) are available but never prominent
- **Celebration-first analytics** presenting insights as achievements rather than performance metrics
- **Contextual time estimation** that learns and suggests without being intrusive

### Core Screens and Views
- **Main Task Dashboard** - Clean list view with quick-add functionality and completion actions
- **Monthly Summary View** - Celebration-focused analytics highlighting progress and improvements
- **Historical Progress View** - Optional deeper dive into past monthly summaries and patterns
- **Task Detail/Edit Modal** - Simple form for editing task details and time estimates
- **Settings/Preferences** - Minimal configuration for personal workflow adaptation

### Accessibility: WCAG AA
Full keyboard navigation support, proper ARIA labels, sufficient color contrast ratios, and screen reader optimization to ensure professional users with diverse accessibility needs can effectively use the application.

### Branding
Clean, modern aesthetic inspired by productivity-focused design systems like Linear or Notion's simpler elements. Emphasize whitespace, subtle typography hierarchy, and celebration-positive color choices (soft greens for completion, warm neutrals for interface). Avoid aggressive gamification colors or anxiety-inducing red indicators.

### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive
Primary focus on desktop/laptop usage for professional workflows, with responsive design ensuring mobile usability for quick task additions. CLI interface serves power users who prefer terminal-based workflows.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure: Monorepo
Single repository containing both frontend and backend with clear separation, enabling simplified development workflow and coordinated deployments while maintaining BMAD principle of intelligent simplicity.

### Service Architecture
**CRITICAL DECISION - Monolithic REST API within Monorepo Structure**
Simple Node.js/Express backend with TypeScript providing REST API endpoints. Monolithic approach aligns with MVP scope and single-developer constraints while avoiding microservices complexity that would violate BMAD methodology. Future GraphQL layer possible if user interaction patterns justify the addition.

### Testing Requirements
**CRITICAL DECISION - Unit + Integration Testing Strategy**
Comprehensive unit tests for business logic (time calculation, monthly summary generation) plus integration tests for API endpoints and database operations. Manual testing convenience methods for user workflow validation. Automated testing pipeline ensures reliability while maintaining development velocity within 20 hours/week constraint.

### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests

**Frontend Technology Stack:**
- TypeScript with React for type safety and component reusability
- Utility-first CSS approach (Tailwind CSS) for rapid UI development and consistent design system
- Offline-first architecture using service workers for core functionality persistence

**Backend Technology Stack:**
- Node.js with Express framework for API development
- SQLite for initial data storage (simple, file-based, no external dependencies)
- Migration path to PostgreSQL documented for future scaling needs

**CLI Interface Priority:**
- CLI as primary interface for power users and development workflow
- Web interface as secondary, responsive companion for visual users
- Shared TypeScript business logic between CLI and web implementations
- CLI supports full feature parity with web interface

**Development & Deployment:**
- Vercel or Netlify for web interface hosting
- npm package distribution for CLI interface
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Development environment using local SQLite with seeded test data

**Authentication & User Management:**
- No authentication system for MVP (single-user focus)
- Local data storage per user environment
- Future multi-user support designed but not implemented initially

**Data Architecture:**
- Minimal schema focusing on task entities with timestamps
- Simple backup/export mechanisms for user data portability
- Local data storage eliminates server-side user management complexity

**Security Considerations:**
- Basic input validation and sanitization for CLI and web inputs
- No sensitive data storage beyond task content
- HTTPS enforcement for web interface communications
- Local data storage reduces attack surface for MVP
