# Story 1.5: Task Editing and Deletion

## Parent Epic
[Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management](../prd/epic-1-foundation-core-task-management.md)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to modify or remove tasks that change or become irrelevant,
**so that** my todo list stays current and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.4 completed the task completion infrastructure with:
- Commander.js 11.1.0 command framework fully operational [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#dev-notes]
- TaskFormatter established for celebration-focused output formatting [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#completion-notes]
- Repository pattern integration working with SQLite and short ID resolution [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#completion-notes]
- Comprehensive test infrastructure in place (74 CLI tests passing) [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#dev-notes]
- Database connection cleanup patterns established with try/finally blocks [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#qa-results]

Key technical components available for reuse:
- `packages/cli/src/commands/` structure for new edit.ts and delete.ts [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#file-list]
- `packages/cli/src/formatters/TaskFormatter.ts` for celebration messaging [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#file-list]
- `packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts` with existing update/delete methods [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#file-list]

### Data Models Integration
**Task Model Edit/Delete Fields:** CLI commands will use existing Task interface from packages/shared/src/models/Task.ts: [Source: architecture/data-models.md#task]
- title: string - Editable field for task description updates
- description: string | null - Editable field for detailed task information
- estimatedMinutes: number | null - Editable field for time estimate updates
- isCompleted: boolean - Must validate edit restrictions on completed tasks
- completedAt: Date | null - Cannot be edited directly, managed by complete/incomplete commands only

**Edit History Preservation:** For AC #7, edits must preserve original createdAt timestamp and avoid modifying completedAt/actualMinutes fields [Source: architecture/data-models.md#task]

### CLI Command Specifications

**Edit Command Format:**
```bash
todo edit <taskId> "new task description"     # Update task title
todo edit <taskId> --estimate 45m            # Update time estimate only
todo edit <taskId> "new title" --estimate 30m # Update both title and estimate
```

**Delete Command Format:**
```bash
todo delete <taskId>              # Delete with confirmation prompt
todo delete <taskId> --force      # Delete without confirmation
```

**Expected Edit Output Format:**
```
‚úèÔ∏è  Task updated successfully!
  üìù #abc123  New task description          [45m estimated]

Updated task details - keep up the great work! üöÄ
```

**Expected Delete Output Format:**
```
üóëÔ∏è  Task deleted successfully!

One less thing on your plate! You're making progress! üåü
```

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Edit command: `packages/cli/src/commands/edit.ts`
- Delete command: `packages/cli/src/commands/delete.ts`
- Edit tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/commands/edit.test.ts`
- Delete tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/commands/delete.test.ts`
- Integration tests: Extend existing `packages/cli/__tests__/integration/cli-workflow.test.ts`

### Repository Pattern Integration
**SQLiteTaskRepository Integration:** Use existing repository methods: [Source: packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts]
- `update(updateData: TaskUpdate): Promise<Task | null>` - For edit operations
- `delete(id: string): Promise<boolean>` - For delete operations
- Short ID resolution via `resolveShortId()` method established in Story 1.4
- Database connection patterns with proper cleanup established

### Celebration-Focused Messaging
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Edit messages must include celebration elements with positive language and appropriate emojis
- Delete messages should maintain positive tone about progress and decluttering
- Transform technical errors into user-friendly messages maintaining celebration tone
- Success messages should reinforce user motivation and task management effectiveness

Examples:
- Edit Success: "‚úèÔ∏è Task updated successfully! Your task list is looking great! üöÄ"
- Delete Success: "üóëÔ∏è Task deleted successfully! One less thing on your plate! üåü"
- Edit Restricted: "This completed task is locked in! Use `todo incomplete <id>` first to make changes. üèÜ"
- Not Found: "Hmm, I couldn't find that task. Try `todo list` to see your active tasks. üîç"

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance:** Sub-1 second response time requirement for edit/delete commands [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]
- **Database Operations:** All operations through shared repository pattern, never direct SQLite [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode compliance with comprehensive JSDoc documentation [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]
- **Commander.js:** Use existing command registration pattern from complete.ts [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#dev-notes]
- **Error Handling:** Transform database errors to user-friendly messages [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Validation Requirements
- **Edit Validation:** Cannot edit completed tasks (AC #5) - must use `todo incomplete <id>` first
- **ID Validation:** Support both full UUIDs and short IDs (7 characters) as established in Story 1.4
- **Input Validation:** Validate task descriptions (1-200 characters), time estimates (1-1440 minutes)
- **Confirmation Logic:** Delete confirmation required unless --force flag provided

### Integration with Existing CLI Infrastructure
- **Command Registration:** Follow patterns established in `packages/cli/src/index.ts` [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#file-list]
- **Formatter Integration:** Use existing `TaskFormatter.ts` methods and add `formatTaskEdited`/`formatTaskDeleted` [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#file-list]
- **Database Connection:** Use established patterns with proper cleanup in try/finally blocks [Source: docs/stories/1.4.task-completion-and-status-management.md#qa-results]
- **Argument Parsing:** Follow Commander.js patterns for argument and option handling

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location:** `packages/cli/__tests__/` with `.test.ts` suffix
- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support
- **Coverage Target:** 80% line coverage for CLI package
- **Test Types:** Unit tests for command handlers, integration tests for CLI workflows
- **CLI Testing:** Spawn actual CLI processes with temporary databases for realistic validation
- **Test Data:** Use existing factory patterns from complete.test.ts for consistency

### Specific Test Requirements
- Test edit command with valid task IDs and various input formats (title only, estimate only, both)
- Test edit command with invalid task IDs and completed tasks (error handling)
- Test delete command with confirmation prompts and --force flag
- Test delete command with invalid task IDs (error handling)
- Test celebration messaging formatting for edit/delete success scenarios
- Test short ID resolution functionality for both edit and delete commands
- Integration test for edit ‚Üí list ‚Üí delete workflow end-to-end
- Test database connection cleanup and proper error handling

### Test Database Strategy
- **Database:** In-memory SQLite for fast test execution [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#integration-tests]
- **Isolation:** Isolated test databases per test suite
- **Cleanup:** Automatic cleanup of temporary databases after each test suite
- **Factory Data:** Use TaskFactory.ts for generating consistent test data
