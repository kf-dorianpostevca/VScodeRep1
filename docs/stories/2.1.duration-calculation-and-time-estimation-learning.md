- Short ID resolution working across all commands [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#completion-notes]

Key technical components available for reuse:
- `packages/cli/src/commands/` structure for new stats.ts [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]
- `packages/cli/src/formatters/TaskFormatter.ts` patterns for celebration messaging [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]
- `packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts` with actualMinutes trigger [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]
- `packages/cli/src/index.ts` command registration patterns [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]

### Data Models Integration
**Task Model Analytics Fields:** CLI stats command will use existing Task interface from packages/shared/src/models/Task.ts: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#task]
- createdAt: Date - Automatic timestamp for duration calculations
- completedAt: Date | null - Timestamp when marked complete, used with createdAt for duration
- estimatedMinutes: number | null - User's time estimate for accuracy learning
- actualMinutes: number | null - Calculated from createdAt/completedAt difference by database trigger
- isCompleted: boolean - Filter for accuracy calculations (only completed tasks)

**MonthlySummary Model Fields:** Future integration for Story 2.2, pre-calculated analytics: [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#monthlysummary]
- estimationAccuracy: number | null - Percentage accuracy for tasks with estimates
- averageActualMinutes: number | null - Mean actual duration for completed tasks
- totalTasks: number - Count of tasks created in month
- completedTasks: number - Count of tasks completed in month

### Database Schema Integration
**Automatic actualMinutes Calculation:** Database trigger handles duration calculation automatically: [Source: docs/architecture/database-schema.md]
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER tasks_calculate_actual_minutes
    AFTER UPDATE OF completed_at ON tasks
    FOR EACH ROW
    WHEN NEW.completed_at IS NOT NULL AND OLD.completed_at IS NULL
BEGIN
    UPDATE tasks
    SET
        actual_minutes = CAST((julianday(NEW.completed_at) - julianday(NEW.created_at)) * 1440 AS INTEGER),
        is_completed = TRUE
    WHERE id = NEW.id;
END;
```

Key points:
- Trigger fires only on initial completion (OLD.completed_at IS NULL)
- Uses Julian day calculation with 1440 multiplier for minute precision
- CAST to INTEGER for consistent data type
- Handles edge case of tasks under 1 minute (rounds to 0 or 1)

### CLI Command Specifications

**Stats Command Format:**
```bash
todo stats                    # Show current month's stats
todo stats --month 2025-08    # Show specific month's stats (future enhancement)
```

**Expected Stats Output Format:**
```
üìä Your Productivity Stats - September 2025

Tasks Overview:
  üéØ Total Tasks: 24
  ‚úÖ Completed: 18 (75%)

```

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- Stats command: `packages/cli/src/commands/stats.ts`
- Estimation service: `packages/shared/src/services/EstimationAccuracyService.ts`
- Stats formatter: `packages/cli/src/formatters/StatsFormatter.ts`
- Time parsing utility: `packages/shared/src/utils/timeParser.ts` (enhance existing)
- Stats command tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/commands/stats.test.ts`
- Service tests: `packages/shared/__tests__/services/EstimationAccuracyService.test.ts`
- Formatter tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/formatters/StatsFormatter.test.ts`
- Integration tests: Extend `packages/cli/__tests__/integration/cli-workflow.test.ts`

### Time Parsing Enhancement
**Supported Formats:** Extend existing time parsing to support: [AC: 3]
- "30m" - Minutes (existing)
- "2h" - Hours (existing)
- "1.5h" - Decimal hours (NEW)
- "90 minutes" - Spelled-out minutes (NEW)
- "2 hours" - Spelled-out hours (future enhancement)

**Parsing Logic:**
```typescript
/**
 * Parse time estimate string into minutes
 * @param input - Time string like "30m", "2h", "1.5h", "90 minutes"
 * @returns Minutes as number
 * @throws Error if format is invalid or out of range (1-1440 minutes)
 * @example
 * parseTimeEstimate("30m")      // 30
 * parseTimeEstimate("2h")       // 120
 * parseTimeEstimate("1.5h")     // 90
 * parseTimeEstimate("90 minutes") // 90
 */
function parseTimeEstimate(input: string): number
```

**Validation Requirements:**
- Minimum: 1 minute (tasks under 1 minute not supported for estimation)
- Maximum: 1440 minutes (24 hours, full day)
- Invalid format throws clear error message
- Case-insensitive matching for "minutes"/"hours"

### EstimationAccuracyService Implementation
**Service Location:** `packages/shared/src/services/EstimationAccuracyService.ts` [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Core Method Signature:**
```typescript
/**
 * Calculate estimation accuracy for a given month
 * @param tasks - Array of completed tasks from the month
 * @returns Accuracy statistics object
 * @example
 * const stats = service.calculateMonthlyAccuracy(tasks);
 * // {
 * //   accuracy: 87.5,
 * //   tasksAnalyzed: 15,
 * //   totalCompleted: 18,
 * //   trend: { direction: 'up', percentage: 12.3 }
 * // }
 */
interface AccuracyStats {
  accuracy: number | null;        // Percentage (0-100), null if no estimates
  tasksAnalyzed: number;          // Count of tasks with estimates
  totalCompleted: number;         // Total completed tasks
  averageEstimate: number | null; // Mean estimated minutes
  averageActual: number | null;   // Mean actual minutes
  trend?: TrendData;              // Optional trend vs previous month
}

calculateMonthlyAccuracy(tasks: Task[], previousMonth?: Task[]): AccuracyStats
```

**Accuracy Calculation Formula:**
```typescript
// For each task with estimate:
// accuracy = 100 - (|actual - estimated| / max(actual, estimated) * 100)
// Overall accuracy = mean of all task accuracies

// Example:
// Task 1: estimated 30m, actual 25m -> 100 - (5/30 * 100) = 83.3%
// Task 2: estimated 60m, actual 70m -> 100 - (10/70 * 100) = 85.7%
// Overall: (83.3 + 85.7) / 2 = 84.5%
```

**Edge Case Handling:** [AC: 6]
- Tasks completed in under 1 minute: Use actualMinutes = 1 for calculations (avoid division by zero)
- No completed tasks: Return null accuracy with friendly message
- No tasks with estimates: Return null accuracy, suggest adding estimates
- All estimates accurate: Return 100% with celebration message
- Previous month comparison: Calculate percentage point difference for trend

### Repository Layer Integration
**Existing Methods Available:** [Source: packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts]
- `findAll(filter?: TaskFilter): Promise<Task[]>` - Query tasks with filters
- `completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task>` - Mark task complete (triggers actualMinutes calculation)

**Query Pattern for Stats:**
```typescript
// Get current month's completed tasks with estimates
const currentMonth = new Date().toISOString().slice(0, 7); // "2025-09"
const tasksWithEstimates = await repository.findAll({
  isCompleted: true,
  createdAfter: new Date(`${currentMonth}-01`),
  createdBefore: new Date(`${currentMonth}-31`)
});

// Filter for tasks with estimates
const tasksToAnalyze = tasksWithEstimates.filter(task =>
  task.estimatedMinutes !== null && task.actualMinutes !== null
);
```

### Celebration-Focused Messaging
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Stats output must lead with accomplishments and positive framing
- Accuracy improvements celebrated with enthusiasm and appropriate emojis
- Lower accuracy framed as learning opportunity, not failure
- Empty states provide helpful guidance and encouragement
- Trend displays use visual indicators (arrows) with celebration language

**Messaging Examples:**
- High accuracy (>85%): "üåü You're getting really good at estimating! Keep it up!"
- Good accuracy (70-85%): "üéØ Nice work! Your estimates are becoming more accurate."
- Learning phase (<70%): "üìö You're learning your patterns! Keep tracking to improve."
- Improvement trend: "üìà ‚Üë 12% improvement from last month! You're on fire!"
- Decline trend: "üí° Accuracy dipped this month - maybe tasks were more complex?"
- No trend data: "üîÆ Complete more tasks next month to see your trend!"

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance:** Stats command must execute in under 1 second for current month [Source: docs/architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#continuous-testing]
- **Database Operations:** All queries through repository pattern, never direct SQLite [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode compliance with comprehensive JSDoc documentation [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#core-standards]
- **Commander.js:** Use existing command registration pattern from complete.ts [Source: packages/cli/src/commands/complete.ts]
- **Error Handling:** Transform database errors to user-friendly messages [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- **Calculation Precision:** Use integer arithmetic for minute calculations to avoid floating-point errors
- **Date Handling:** Use ISO 8601 format for month identifiers (YYYY-MM)

### Integration with Existing CLI Infrastructure
- **Command Registration:** Follow patterns established in `packages/cli/src/index.ts` [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]
- **Formatter Pattern:** Create StatsFormatter similar to TaskFormatter structure [Source: docs/stories/1.5.task-editing-and-deletion.md#file-list]
- **Database Connection:** Use established patterns with proper cleanup in try/finally blocks [Source: packages/cli/src/commands/complete.ts]
- **Logging:** Use createLogger from shared package for consistent logging [Source: packages/cli/src/commands/complete.ts]
- **Error Formatting:** Use formatError from TaskFormatter for consistency [Source: packages/cli/src/commands/complete.ts]

### Service Layer Architecture
**Service Location:** Services belong in shared package for reuse across CLI/API/Web [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Service Pattern:**
```typescript
// packages/shared/src/services/EstimationAccuracyService.ts
import { Task } from '../models/Task';
import { createLogger } from '../utils/logger';

const logger = createLogger('estimation-accuracy-service');

/**
 * Service for calculating time estimation accuracy and learning metrics.
 * Provides insights for improving time planning skills.
 */
export class EstimationAccuracyService {
  /**
   * Calculate monthly estimation accuracy from completed tasks
   */
  calculateMonthlyAccuracy(tasks: Task[], previousMonth?: Task[]): AccuracyStats {
    // Implementation
  }

  /**
   * Calculate trend comparison between two periods
   */
  private calculateTrend(current: number, previous: number): TrendData {
    // Implementation
  }

  /**
   * Calculate individual task accuracy
   */
  private calculateTaskAccuracy(estimated: number, actual: number): number {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

- ‚úÖ Optional --month flag added (infrastructure ready for future use)

**Estimation Accuracy Service (AC: 1, 4, 5, 6):**
- ‚úÖ EstimationAccuracyService calculates monthly accuracy percentage
- ‚úÖ Compares current vs previous month for trend analysis
- ‚úÖ Only includes completed tasks with estimates in calculations
- ‚úÖ Handles all edge cases gracefully with null accuracy when appropriate

**Database Integration (AC: 1):**
- ‚úÖ Database trigger `tasks_calculate_actual_minutes` verified operational
- ‚úÖ Uses Julian day calculation for minute precision
- ‚úÖ Fixed date filtering to use `completedAfter`/`completedBefore` with inclusive comparisons (`>=`, `<=`)

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ 170 tests passing in CLI package
- ‚úÖ 20 TimeEstimateParser tests covering all formats
- ‚úÖ 14 stats command unit tests
- ‚úÖ 20 StatsFormatter tests for output formatting
