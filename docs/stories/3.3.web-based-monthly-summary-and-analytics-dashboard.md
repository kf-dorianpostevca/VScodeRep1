## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Dependencies
Story 3.1 provides REST API foundation:
- Express.js API infrastructure for analytics endpoints [Source: docs/stories/3.1.rest-api-foundation-and-shared-business-logic.md]
- Shared business logic patterns for consistent data processing [Source: docs/stories/3.1.rest-api-foundation-and-shared-business-logic.md]

Story 3.2 provides React foundation:
- React component architecture and responsive design patterns [Source: docs/stories/3.2.react-web-interface-with-task-management.md]
- Tailwind CSS styling and brand guidelines [Source: docs/stories/3.2.react-web-interface-with-task-management.md]
- API service integration patterns [Source: docs/stories/3.2.react-web-interface-with-task-management.md]

### Analytics Implementation Strategy
**MVP Scope (Epic 3.3):**
- Basic monthly summaries using existing Task model
- Simple completion charts and trends
- Foundation for future Epic 2 enhancements

**Future Enhancement (Post-Epic 2):**
- Time estimation accuracy analytics
- Advanced productivity insights
- Enhanced celebration-focused reporting

**Implementation Approach:** Focus on basic analytics that provide immediate value while creating extensible architecture for Epic 2 features.

### Technology Stack for Analytics
**Charting Library:** Recharts 2.8.0 for seamless React TypeScript integration [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#frontend-framework]
**Rationale:** Better React component patterns, TypeScript support, and responsive design capabilities than Chart.js
**Data Visualization:** TypeScript interfaces for chart data consistency
**Performance:** Memoization and lazy loading for chart rendering
**Export:** Basic data export functionality for personal record keeping

### Analytics Data Model
**Basic Monthly Summary (Available Now):**
```typescript
interface MonthlySummaryBasic {
  month: string;           // YYYY-MM format
  totalTasks: number;      // Total tasks created
  completedTasks: number;  // Tasks marked complete
  completionRate: number;  // Percentage completed
  dailyCompletions: {      // Daily completion counts for charts
    date: string;          // YYYY-MM-DD format
    completed: number;     // Tasks completed on date
  }[];
  monthlyTrend: {         // Month-over-month comparison
    previousMonth: number; // Previous month completion rate
    improvement: number;   // Percentage change
  };
}
```


### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Analytics page: `packages/web/src/pages/AnalyticsPage.tsx`
- Summary components: `packages/web/src/components/analytics/`
- Chart components: `packages/web/src/components/charts/`
- API routes: `packages/api/src/routes/analytics.ts`
- Controllers: `packages/api/src/controllers/AnalyticsController.ts`
- Tests: `packages/web/__tests__/components/analytics/`

### Analytics API Endpoints Design
**Current Month Summary:**
```typescript
GET /api/v1/analytics/monthly
Response: MonthlySummaryBasic with current month data
```

**Historical Summary:**
```typescript
GET /api/v1/analytics/monthly/2025/08
Response: MonthlySummaryBasic for specified month
```

**Completion Patterns:**
```typescript
GET /api/v1/analytics/patterns?period=month&date=2025-09
Response: Daily/weekly completion data for visualization
```

### Visual Design Requirements
**Celebration-Focused Design:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Green and blue color scheme emphasizing achievement
- Progress bars and completion meters with satisfying animations
- Positive language in all analytics descriptions
- Achievement badges and milestone celebrations

**Chart Styling:**
- Consistent brand colors matching overall application design
- Accessible color contrasts for color-blind users
- Clean, minimal design avoiding overwhelming data presentations
- Interactive hover states with celebration micro-animations

### Database Query Optimization
**Aggregation Queries:**
```sql
-- Basic monthly completion counts
SELECT DATE(completedAt) as date, COUNT(*) as completed
FROM tasks
WHERE completedAt IS NOT NULL
  AND strftime('%Y-%m', completedAt) = ?
GROUP BY DATE(completedAt)

-- Monthly task creation vs completion
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as created,
  SUM(CASE WHEN isCompleted = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as completed
FROM tasks
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m', createdAt) = ?
```

### Print and Export Functionality
**Print Optimization:**
- Print-specific CSS with proper page breaks and margins
- Black and white compatible design for cost-effective printing
- Header/footer with month/year and page numbers
- Condensed layout fitting standard letter-size paper

**Basic Export Features:**
- Simple data export for personal record keeping
- Print-friendly summary layouts
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality for key metrics

### Performance Considerations
**Data Caching:** [Source: architecture/rest-api-spec.md]
- Cache monthly summaries for completed months (immutable data)
- Refresh current month data with reasonable intervals (5 minutes)
- Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed months

**Chart Performance:**
- Lazy load chart libraries only when analytics page accessed
- Memoize chart data to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Use virtualization for large datasets when Epic 2 features added
- Progressive data loading for historical summaries

### Accessibility for Analytics
**Screen Reader Support:**
- Alternative text descriptions for all charts and graphs
- Data tables providing chart data in accessible format
- ARIA labels for interactive chart elements
- Keyboard navigation for chart interactions

**Visual Accessibility:**
- High contrast mode support for chart colors
- Scalable text and interface elements
- Alternative representations for color-coded information
- Focus indicators for keyboard navigation
