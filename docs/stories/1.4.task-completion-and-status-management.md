# Story 1.4: Task Completion and Status Management

## Parent Epic
[Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management](../prd/epic-1-foundation-core-task-management.md)

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to mark tasks as complete and see my progress,
**so that** I can track accomplishments and maintain momentum.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `todo complete <id>` marks task as done with completion timestamp
2. `todo done <id>` serves as alias for completion command
3. Completed tasks visually distinguished in list display (strikethrough, checkmark)
4. `todo list --completed` shows only finished tasks
5. Completion action provides positive confirmation message
6. Cannot complete already completed tasks (with clear error message)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.3 completed the CLI infrastructure with:
- Commander.js 11.1.0 command framework fully operational
- TaskFormatter established for consistent output formatting
- Repository pattern integration working with SQLite
- Celebration-focused messaging patterns established
- Time estimate parsing utilities available for reuse
- Comprehensive test infrastructure in place (74 CLI tests passing)

Key technical components available:
- packages/cli/src/commands/ structure for new complete.ts
- packages/cli/src/formatters/TaskFormatter.ts for enhanced list display
- packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts for data operations

### Task Completion Workflow Integration
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md#task-creation-and-completion-workflow]
The completion workflow follows this sequence:
User executes `todo complete abc123` → CLI parses taskId → Shared.completeTask() → Repository.updateTask() → SQLite UPDATE with completedAt timestamp → Analytics.calculateActualMinutes() → Success response with celebration message

Key workflow elements:
- Automatic completion timestamp capture
- Actual minutes calculation from createdAt/completedAt difference
- Celebration-focused messaging with time comparison
- Integration with existing repository and analytics patterns

### Data Models Integration
**Task Model Completion Fields:** CLI commands will use existing Task interface from packages/shared/src/models/Task.ts:
- completedAt: Date | null - Timestamp when marked complete (updated by completion command)
- isCompleted: boolean - Status flag for filtering (set to true on completion)
- actualMinutes: number | null - Calculated from timestamp difference (auto-computed)
- createdAt: Date - Used for duration calculation (readonly, already captured)
[Source: architecture/data-models.md, packages/shared/src/models/Task.ts]

### CLI Command Specifications

**Complete Command Format:**
```bash
todo complete <taskId>     # Mark task as complete
todo done <taskId>         # Alias for complete command
```

**Enhanced List Command:**
```bash
todo list                  # Show pending tasks (existing)
todo list --all           # Show all tasks (existing)
todo list --completed     # Show only completed tasks (new)
```

**Expected Output Format:**
```
Completed Tasks:
  ✅ #abc123  Review PRD documentation          [30m → 25m] ✨ 5m under estimate!
  ✅ #def456  Update test cases                 [1h → 1h15m] Completed yesterday

2 tasks completed
```

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Complete command: `packages/cli/src/commands/complete.ts`
- Enhanced formatter: `packages/cli/src/formatters/TaskFormatter.ts` (modify existing)
- Complete tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/commands/complete.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `packages/cli/__tests__/integration/` (extend existing cli-workflow.test.ts)

### Repository Pattern Integration
**SQLiteTaskRepository Updates:** Add completeTask method to existing repository:
- Method signature: `completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task>`
- Update completedAt with current timestamp
- Set isCompleted to true
- Calculate actualMinutes from createdAt/completedAt difference
- Return updated Task entity for confirmation message
[Source: packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts, architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Celebration-Focused Messaging
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Completion messages must include celebration elements with positive language and appropriate emojis
- Include time comparison when estimates available (estimated vs actual)
- Transform technical errors into user-friendly messages maintaining celebration tone
- Success messages should reinforce user motivation and accomplishments

Examples:
- Success: "🎉 Task completed! Estimated 30m, took 25m - Great job staying under time!"
- Success (no estimate): "✅ Task completed successfully! You're making great progress!"
- Already completed: "This task is already done! You're on top of things! 🌟"
- Not found: "Hmm, I couldn't find that task. Try `todo list` to see your active tasks."

### Technical Constraints
- **Performance:** Sub-1 second response time requirement for completion commands
- **Idempotent Operations:** Completing already completed tasks returns success with friendly message (no error)
- **Repository Integration:** All database operations through shared repository pattern (never direct SQLite)
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode compliance with comprehensive JSDoc documentation
- **Commander.js:** Use existing command registration pattern from add.ts and list.ts
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md, architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Timestamp and Duration Calculations
**Completion Timestamp:** Use Date.now() or new Date() for completedAt field
**Actual Minutes Calculation:** Math.round((completedAt - createdAt) / (1000 * 60)) for minute precision
**Time Comparison Logic:** Display estimated vs actual with celebration language for under/over estimates
[Source: architecture/core-workflows.md, packages/shared/src/utils/time.ts if available]

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]
- **Test Location:** `packages/cli/__tests__/` with `.test.ts` suffix
- **Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support
- **Coverage Target:** 80% line coverage for CLI package
- **Test Types:** Unit tests for command handlers, integration tests for CLI workflows
- **CLI Testing:** Spawn actual CLI processes with temporary databases for realistic validation
- **Test Data:** Use existing patterns from add.test.ts and list.test.ts for consistency

### Specific Test Requirements
- Test complete command with valid task IDs (success path)
- Test complete command with invalid task IDs (error handling)
- Test done alias functionality (command registration)
- Test completion of already completed tasks (idempotent behavior)
- Test list --completed flag functionality
- Test celebration messaging with various time estimate scenarios
- Test timestamp capture and actualMinutes calculation accuracy
- Integration test for complete workflow end-to-end
