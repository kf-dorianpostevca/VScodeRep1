### Technology Stack for Web Package
**Frontend Framework:** React 18.2.0 for component architecture [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Build Tool:** Vite 4.5.0 for fast development and bundling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS 3.3.5 for utility-first styling [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Language:** TypeScript 5.2.2 with React TypeScript support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Testing:** Jest 29.7.0 with React Testing Library [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
**Package Manager:** npm 10.2.0 with workspace support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### Web Package Architecture
**Location:** packages/web/ following monorepo structure [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
**Dependencies:** packages/api for REST endpoints [Source: architecture/components.md#web-interface-package]
**Key Components:** React components, service workers, PWA shell [Source: architecture/components.md]
**Responsive Design:** Desktop, tablet, mobile support with celebration-focused UI [Source: architecture/components.md#web-interface-package]

### Component Architecture Design
**Core Components:**
- `TaskList.tsx` - Main task display with filtering and real-time updates
- `TaskItem.tsx` - Individual task with inline editing, completion, deletion
- `AddTaskForm.tsx` - Task creation with validation and celebration feedback
- `TaskFilters.tsx` - Status filtering (pending/completed/all) matching CLI
- `Layout.tsx` - Responsive layout container with navigation

**Hook Architecture:**
- `useTasks.tsx` - Task management state and API operations
- `useKeyboardShortcuts.tsx` - Keyboard shortcut handling
- `useOfflineSync.tsx` - Offline functionality and sync management
- `useApiClient.tsx` - API communication with error handling

### File Locations for New Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- React components: `packages/web/src/components/`
- Page components: `packages/web/src/pages/`
- API services: `packages/web/src/services/TaskApiService.ts`
- Custom hooks: `packages/web/src/hooks/`
- Service worker: `packages/web/public/sw.js`
- Tests: `packages/web/__tests__/components/`
- Configuration: `packages/web/vite.config.ts`, `packages/web/tailwind.config.js`

### API Integration Patterns
**REST API Communication:** [Source: docs/stories/3.1.rest-api-foundation-and-shared-business-logic.md]
- `GET /api/v1/tasks` - Fetch tasks with status filtering
- `POST /api/v1/tasks` - Create new tasks with celebration responses
- `PUT /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Update tasks with optimistic UI updates
- `DELETE /api/v1/tasks/:id` - Delete tasks with confirmation
- `POST /api/v1/tasks/:id/complete` - Mark complete with celebration

**Service Architecture:**
```typescript
class TaskApiService {
  async getTasks(status?: 'pending' | 'completed' | 'all'): Promise<Task[]>
  async createTask(data: CreateTaskRequest): Promise<Task>
  async updateTask(id: string, data: UpdateTaskRequest): Promise<Task>
  async deleteTask(id: string): Promise<void>
  async completeTask(id: string): Promise<Task>
}
```

### Responsive Design Requirements
**Breakpoints:** [Source: architecture/components.md#web-interface-package]
- Mobile: 320px - 767px (single column, touch-friendly)
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px (optimized for touch and keyboard)
- Desktop: 1024px+ (keyboard shortcuts, hover states)

**Touch Interactions:**
- Swipe gestures for task completion/deletion on mobile
- Touch-friendly button sizing (minimum 44px tap targets)
- Pull-to-refresh for task list updates
- Long press for context menus

### Celebration-Focused UI Design
**Visual Elements:** [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]
- Success animations for task completion
- Progress indicators with positive language
- Color scheme emphasizing achievement (greens, blues)
- Micro-interactions that provide satisfying feedback

**Messaging Consistency:**
- Use celebration messages from shared services
- Transform technical errors into encouraging language
- Provide helpful suggestions for user actions
- Maintain positive tone throughout all interactions

### Keyboard Shortcuts Specification
**Primary shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+N` / `Cmd+N` - Open new task form
- `Enter` - Submit task creation form
- `Escape` - Cancel current action/close modals
- `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` - Navigate through tasks
- `Space` - Toggle task completion
- `Delete` - Delete selected task (with confirmation)
- `?` - Show keyboard shortcuts help

### Offline Functionality Architecture
**Service Worker:** [Source: architecture/components.md#web-interface-package]
- Cache task data for offline access
- Queue offline actions for sync when online
- Provide offline indicators and messaging
- Handle background sync for seamless experience

**Offline Storage:**
- IndexedDB for task data caching
- LocalStorage for user preferences and UI state
- Sync queue management for offline actions
- Conflict resolution strategies for data consistency

### Performance Requirements
**Rendering Performance:**
- Virtual scrolling for large task lists (100+ items)
- Debounced search and filtering operations
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Optimized re-renders using React.memo and useMemo

**Loading States:**
- Skeleton screens during data fetching
- Progressive enhancement for slower connections
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Graceful degradation for offline scenarios

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG 2.1 Compliance:**
- Proper ARIA labels for screen readers
- Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Color contrast ratios meeting AA standards
- Focus indicators for keyboard users
- Semantic HTML structure throughout

## Testing
