### Basic PWA Technology Stack
**Service Worker:** [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- Simple service worker for basic caching and app installation
- Cache API for offline static asset storage
- Basic offline page functionality
- Simple cache management and cleanup

**Web App Manifest:**
- Application metadata with branded icons and colors
- Installation prompts and app behavior configuration
- Platform-specific customizations (iOS, Android, Desktop)
- Theme colors and display preferences

**Basic PWA APIs:**
- Service Worker API for installation and caching
- Cache API for offline resource storage
- Network Information API for online/offline detection
- Local Storage for basic offline data caching

### PWA Architecture Design
**Location:** packages/web/ with PWA-specific configurations [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
**Service Worker:** `packages/web/public/sw.js` with Workbox integration
**Manifest:** `packages/web/public/manifest.json` with brand guidelines
**Icons:** `packages/web/public/icons/` with multiple sizes and formats

### Core Functionality Consistency
**Feature Parity Requirements:**
- Task CRUD operations: ✅ CLI + Web (through shared API)
- Task completion: ✅ CLI + Web (through shared business logic)
- Monthly summaries: ✅ CLI + Web (Story 3.3 integration)
- Data consistency: ✅ Same SQLite database accessed through API
- Celebration messaging: ✅ Consistent tone and language
- Error handling: ✅ Shared validation and error patterns

### Simple Data Refresh Strategy
**Basic Synchronization:**
- Manual refresh when app regains network connection
- Simple API polling for data updates (not real-time)
- User-initiated refresh actions
- Clear indicators when data may be stale

**Offline Data Handling:**
- Cache current tasks for offline viewing (read-only)
- Show clear offline indicators
- Graceful handling of offline action attempts
- Simple data refresh on reconnection

### File Locations for Basic PWA Code
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Service worker: `packages/web/public/sw.js`
- Web manifest: `packages/web/public/manifest.json`
- PWA icons: `packages/web/public/icons/` (16x16 to 512x512)
- Offline components: `packages/web/src/components/offline/`
- PWA utilities: `packages/web/src/utils/pwa.ts`
- Installation prompts: `packages/web/src/components/InstallPrompt.tsx`


### Brand Guidelines for PWA
**App Identity:**
- App name: "Intelligent Todo" matching CLI branding
- Primary colors: celebration-focused blues and greens
