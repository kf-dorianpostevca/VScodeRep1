# Story 1.2: Basic Task Data Model and Storage

## Status
Approved for development

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my tasks stored reliably with timestamps,
**so that** my todo data persists between CLI sessions and supports future analytics.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. SQLite database schema supports task ID, title, description, timestamps, completion status
2. Database connection and basic CRUD operations implemented with proper error handling
3. Task creation automatically captures creation timestamp
4. Task completion captures completion timestamp when marked done
5. Data integrity constraints prevent invalid task states
6. Database file created in user's home directory for persistence

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous story completed yet - this is the foundation story for data persistence.

### Data Models
**Task Model:** Core entity with UUID primary key, required title (max 200 chars), optional description (max 1000 chars), creation/completion timestamps, estimated/actual minutes, completion status boolean, and optional tags array for future categorization. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#task]

**Key Attributes:**
- id: string (UUID) - Unique identifier for CLI operations
- title: string - Required, 1-200 characters
- description: string | null - Optional, max 1000 characters
- createdAt: Date - Automatic timestamp for analytics
- completedAt: Date | null - Capture when marked complete
- estimatedMinutes: number | null - User time estimates (1-1440 minutes)
- actualMinutes: number | null - Calculated duration
- isCompleted: boolean - Status flag for filtering
- tags: string[] - Future enhancement for categorization
[Source: architecture/data-models.md#task]

### Database Schema
**SQLite Schema:** Uses better-sqlite3 driver with synchronous API for performance. Tasks table includes UUID primary key generation, length constraints on text fields, check constraints for time values, and automated triggers for actual minutes calculation. Database includes performance indexes on completion status, creation date, and completion date. [Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

**Key Schema Elements:**
- PRIMARY KEY with UUID generation: `DEFAULT (lower(hex(randomblob(16))))`
- Title validation: `CHECK (length(title) > 0 AND length(title) <= 200)`
- Time constraints: `CHECK (estimated_minutes > 0 AND estimated_minutes <= 1440)`
- Automatic actual_minutes trigger on completion timestamp update
- Performance indexes: `idx_tasks_is_completed`, `idx_tasks_created_at`, `idx_tasks_completed_at`
[Source: architecture/database-schema.md]

### Repository Pattern Implementation
**Repository Pattern:** All database operations must use Repository pattern - never access SQLite directly from services. TaskRepository interface defines CRUD operations with proper error handling and type safety. Implementation uses better-sqlite3 for synchronous operations and improved performance over node-sqlite3. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### File Locations
Based on monorepo structure, data access components should be located in:
- Data models: `packages/shared/src/models/Task.ts`
- Repository interfaces: `packages/shared/src/repositories/ITaskRepository.ts`
- SQLite implementation: `packages/shared/src/repositories/SQLiteTaskRepository.ts`
- Database utilities: `packages/shared/src/utils/database.ts`
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints
**Runtime:** Node.js 20.9.0 LTS with TypeScript 5.2.2 strict mode enabled
**Database:** SQLite 3.44.0 with better-sqlite3 9.1.0 driver for synchronous API performance
**Error Handling:** Never expose database errors to users - transform to user-friendly messages maintaining celebration-focused tone
**JSDoc Requirements:** All public functions and interfaces must include comprehensive JSDoc with @param, @returns, @throws, and @example tags
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-rules]

### Testing
**Test Framework:** Jest 29.7.0 with TypeScript support via ts-jest
**Test Location:** Unit tests in `packages/shared/__tests__/` directory with `.test.ts` suffix
**Coverage Target:** 90% line coverage for shared package business logic
**Database Testing:** In-memory SQLite for fast test execution with isolated test databases per test suite
**Test Organization:** Factory pattern with `TaskFactory.ts` for realistic data generation
**Test Types:** Unit tests for models and repository, integration tests for cross-package database operations
