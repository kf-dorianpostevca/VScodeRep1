## Production Notes

Current icons are placeholder implementations. For production deployment:

1. Replace with professionally designed icons created by a graphic designer
2. Ensure all sizes maintain visual consistency
3. Test icon appearance across different platforms and backgrounds
4. Validate icon readability at smallest sizes (16x16)
5. Consider platform-specific design guidelines (iOS, Android, Windows)

## Generating Icons

To create placeholder icons (requires Node.js and canvas library):
```bash
npm install canvas
node create-icons.js
```

Note: The canvas library may require additional system dependencies on some platforms.
